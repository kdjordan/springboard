Quiz
What is the difference between var and let?
Var and let differ in how their scoping is handled. 
With var the value is attached to the window object and thus is globally scoped if outside of a code block.
Var is function scoped while let is block scoped.

What is the difference between var and const?
Var values can be reassigned and by default are fucntion scoped.
Var values are also attached to the window object.
Const values cannot be changed and are block scoped.

What is the difference between let and const?
Let values can be reassigned.
Const values can never be changed or updated.
Both are block scoped.

What is hoisting?
Hoisting is taking a variable definition and 'bringing it to the top of the page'.
This allows you to refer to a variable before it has been written within the code (as long as it has been declared), when using var of course.
It is important to note that only the declaration is hoisted, not any initailization.
