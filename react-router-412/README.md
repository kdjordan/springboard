### React Router

So I dove into these projects and started eveything off use react router v6 because I was using React 18 as version.  
Probably not the best idea, as everything went OK until I got to the testing aspect of the exercises.  
Then, I went back and reworked everything with an older versions of everything by starting a blank project and using the package.json from the couse downloads to get things working.  
That went a lot better until I tried testing some routes for the color factory.  
By this point I had spent a lot of hours crashing around different docs and stackoverflow, so I decided that I needed to move on.  
I will ask about these issues with my mentor this upcoming week.  
Both versions of both projects are included.
